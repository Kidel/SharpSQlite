# SharpSQlite
A very very basic **ASP.NET Core** web application using **SQlite** as DBMS.
I basically keep it here to reuse it fast in new applications.

![SQlite logo](https://sqlite.org/images/sqlite370_banner.gif)

Requires `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore 1.0.0` and `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SQlite 1.0.0` and of course `.NET Core`. Developed using **Visual Studio 2017** and **Câ™¯**,

**Live demo**: [http://SharpSQlite.AzureWebsites.net](http://sharpsqlite.azurewebsites.net)

## Why do I need it?
This repository is actually just meant to give me easy access to a framework that uses MVC and SQlite as DBMS, fast and easy to deploy on **Azure**. However I made it public so that it can be used by whoever may need it.
